Structured logging enables standardized formats for effortless parsing, querying, and analytics. 

A log management system must parse the files to extract meaningful information from logs.

Log parsers are built into the log management software’s engine.

Monitoring and analyzing logs enhance the observability of the network, providing transparency and visibility. 

Storing log data is required for different reasons, including the reliability of systems, the security posture of environments, improvement in IT systems’ decision-making, and auditing purposes. 

Visualizing the log data spanning days or weeks is necessary to gain insights into an app’s behavior and performance changes over time.

Storing logs in the cloud enables scalable storage capacity that aligns with log data needs.

You can back up data to on-premises servers or in the cloud for storing logs.

A few analytical dimensions that give a relative idea of how long the retention period should be criticality, security, maturity, frequency, cost-effectiveness, and discovery and resolution.

It is important to consider the best practices for storing logs.
