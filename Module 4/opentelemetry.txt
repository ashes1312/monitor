Telemetry is the automated process of collecting and transmitting data from remote or inaccessible sources to support monitoring and analysis.

Telemetry is essential for developers to spot application errors and crashes, analyze performance metrics, use analytics, and monitor security events.

The key benefits of telemetry include remote feedback, real-time monitoring of application performance, user activity and experience, and network analytics and security.

Distributed tracing is a technique of observing requests transmitted through distributed cloud environments.
