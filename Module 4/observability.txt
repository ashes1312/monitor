The three pillars of observability are 
logs 
metrics 
traces

Logs capture detailed information about individual events or transactions, giving you a chronological record of what happened.

Metrics are numerical measurements with accompanying attributes that show the health of a particular system component.

Traces are records of the information pathways or workflows that are created to follow a work item, like a transaction.

Cloud native observability is the practice of monitoring and understanding the behavior of cloud-native applications running in dynamic and distributed environments.

The pillars of cloud enterprise observability are automation, context, and intelligent action.

Cloud native observability tools and solutions are critical for organizations and can correlate telemetry data across cloud environments at a massive scale.

Popular cloud native observability tools: 
Prometheus
Jaeger 
FluentD 
Thanos 
Datadog 
New Relic 
AWS CloudWatch 
Google Cloud Monitoring 
Instana 
Mezmo

Sampling in logging is the practice of collecting only a subset of log events for analysis or storage. Instead of logging every single event or piece of data, a subset is selected randomly or by some other criteria for recording.

Advantages of sampling: Reduced overhead, enhanced performance, cost-effectiveness, improved accuracy, and better scalability.

Disadvantages of sampling: Missing details, inaccurate data, limited resolution, masked outliers, and challenges in diagnosing complex performance issues.
